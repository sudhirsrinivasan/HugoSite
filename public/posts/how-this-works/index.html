<p>This is a post on how this website is built. I am back to building software in my spare time and I wanted to start documenting the progress. I considered various blog/email software like medium and substack but decided to build my own since I will own the data and I enjoy the building process.</p>
<h2 id="site-generator">Site Generator</h2>
<p>After years of working in the software industry I have come to appreciate the simplicity of generating html content. My goal is to see how much I can retain the core of a site that is generated html content but try to add dynamic components to it. I will be hosting it on AWS using amplify.</p>
<h2 id="choice-of-site-generator">Choice of Site Generator</h2>
<p>After looking at a few I decided to go with <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a></p>
<h2 id="setup-of-mac">Setup of mac</h2>
<p>Installed brew
Installed hugo
Created a github account
Created an AWS account</p>
<h2 id="setup-ssh-to-access-github">Setup SSH to access github</h2>
<p>Used <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent">https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent</a></p>

<h2 id="getting-started-with-hugo">Getting started with Hugo</h2>
<p>I followed this <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/</a>
But with one difference. I created a repository on github. Then git cloned it git clone <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:sudhirsrinivasan/HugoSite.git
Then I ran hugo new site HugoSite &ndash;force
Also after making the changes
git add &ndash;all
git push</p>
<h2 id="hosting-on-amplify">Hosting on Amplify</h2>
<p>I followed this website - <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-aws-amplify/">https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-aws-amplify/</a><br>
But one key point here. I had to do the force amplify to use the newer version <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-aws-amplify/#using-a-newer-version-of-hugo">https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-aws-amplify/#using-a-newer-version-of-hugo</a>
Also I edited the build file on amplify to add hugo as a command and public directory</p>
